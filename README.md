# How to use it ?
- Compile the file, for example `gcc rev.c -o reverse`.
- Now you can use it with many ways :
First example : `echo Khiro | ./reverse`, the result will be : orihK
Second example : you lunch `./reverse`, then you can write what you want, and everytime you press 'enter', you will have your sentence reversed.
